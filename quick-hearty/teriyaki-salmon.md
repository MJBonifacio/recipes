## Ingredients
* 4 salmon fillets (approximately 4 ounces each)
* salt and pepper to taste
* cooking spray
* 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
* 2 tablespoons sesame seeds
* 2 tablespoons sliced green onions
* For the teriyaki sauce:
* 2 tablespoons soy sauce
* 1/4 cup water
* 1 1/2 tablespoons brown sugar
* 1 teaspoon minced garlic
* 1 teaspoon minced ginger
* 2 teaspoons of honey
* 1/2 teaspoon toasted sesame oil
* 2 teaspoons cornstarch

## Procedure
1. For the teriyaki sauce: Place the soy sauce, water, brown sugar, garlic, ginger, honey and sesame oil in a small pot over medium high heat. Stir until sugar is dissolved, about 3 minutes. Turn up heat to high and bring to a boil.
2. Mix the cornstarch with 1 tablespoon of cold water until dissolved. Add the cornstarch mixture to the sauce and boil for 1-2 minutes or until sauce has thickened. Set sauce aside.
3. Heat the oil in a large pan over high heat. Season the salmon fillets with salt and pepper to taste. Place the salmon, skin side up in the pan and sear until a golden brown crust forms, about 5 minutes. Turn the salmon and cook for approximately 5 minutes on the other side, or until cooked through.
4. Pour the teriyaki sauce over the salmon. Add the sesame seeds and green onions and serve.
