## Ingredients
### Meat
* 4 pork chops, bone in or boneless ((about 1-inch thick))
* 1 teaspoon Seasoning salt ((adjust to your taste))
* 1/3 teaspoon cracked black pepper
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 2 tablespoons unsalted butter

### Creamy Mushroom Sauce
* 1 cup sliced brown mushrooms
* 2 tablespoons fresh chopped parsley, (divided)
* 1 tablespoon fresh chopped thyme
* 4 cloves garlic (crushed)
* 3/4 cup reduced fat cream or half and half, ((heavy cream or evaporated milk))

## Procedure
1. Season chops with seasoning salt and pepper. Heat oil and butter in a frying pan or skillet over medium-high until butter is melted.
2. When pan is hot, sear chops for about 3-4 minutes per side until golden browned and the centre is no longer bright pink (fry in batches if you need to). Transfer to a warm plate. Set aside.
3. Add the mushrooms to the buttery juices in the pan and cook for 3-4 minutes over medium heat. Scrape up any bits left over from the chops. When mushrooms are browned, add half parsley, half thyme and all of the crushed garlic; saut√© for 30 seconds until fragrant.
4. Pour in the cream and bring to a gentle simmer for 3-4 minutes until slightly thickened. Season with salt and pepper, to your taste.
5. Add the chops back into the sauce, allow to simmer for a minute to heat through. Garnish with remaining herbs and serve immediately.
