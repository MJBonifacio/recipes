# Chicken Adobo
Less trouble if you buy a whole chicken that is already cut in half. Pork ribs may also be added. We want the bones for all that delicious flavor.

## Ingredients
* 6 cloves garlic – crushed and cut to smaller pieces (set aside 2 portions of 3 cloves each)
* 15-20 pieces whole black peppercorns
* 1/ 2 cup vinegar
* 2 cups water
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 2 tablespoon soy sauce
* 4 tablespoons cooking oil (we use olive oil)

## Procedure
### Prep
Marinate chicken for 10 minutes, with:
* 3 cloves crushed garlic
* peppercorns
* vinegar
* water
* salt
and mix around to distribute the marinade.

### Cooking
#### Brown garlic
*	Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a 2-quart pot, or frying pan that can accommodate chicken and marinade (non-stick preferred, use pot for less splatter)
*	When hot, add 1-1/2 clove portion of garlic, fry until almost crispy brown

#### Simmer chicken with Marinade
*	Add the chicken slowly then pour in the marinade
*	Wait to boil, and boil for about 10 minutes – DO NOT cover
*	After boiling for 10 minutes, drain the marinade in a bowl (SAVE for later use) - leave the chicken in the pot
*	Keep boiling the chicken with the marinade still in the pot

#### Brown the chicken
*	When the marinade starts to dry out and sizzling, add 3 tablespoon cooking oil
*	Fry the chicken pieces to light brown. Turn the pieces for uniform frying
*	When browned to your satisfaction, pour in the 2 tbsp soy sauce. Mix around while the soy sauce sizzles.

#### Finish and serve
*	Pour the SAVED boiled marinade and boil for about 2 minutes.
*	Season with salt to taste (add 1/2 cup water for more sauce if desired)
