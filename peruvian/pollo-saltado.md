## Ingredients
* 1 lb. chicken breast, skinned, bonned, and cut in thin slices
* 2 garlic cloves finely diced
* 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
* 1 red onion cut in thick slices
* 2 tomatoes cut in thick slices
* 1 seeded and ribbed aji amarillo chili pepper cut in thin slices * (you can substitute with 1 tablespoon of aji­ amarillo paste, or * with any chili pepper you can find)
* 3 tablespoons soy sauce
* 3 tablespoons red wine vinegar
* Salt and pepper
* ½ cup fresh cilantro, chopped
* 2 cups French fries
* White rice as a side dish

## Procedure
1. Season the chicken stripes with salt and pepper.
2. Put a wok or a pan over very high heat. When it is smoking, add the oil, let smoke again, add and saute the chicken, a few slices at a time so they don't steam but remain golden instead (about 10 minutes, depending on how strong the flame is).
3. In a home stove it´s almost impossible to get that kind of heat, besides, the fire alarm will alert the Firefighters and all the experience will be a mess.
4. Add garlic, onion, tomato, chili pepper, and stir for a couple of minutes. Add the soy sauce and vinegar on the sides of the pan and mix everything. Season with more salt and pepper.
5. Take off the heat, add chopped cilantro and serve at once with French fries and white rice.
